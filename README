so_long is a 2d game.

to start it :
$> make
$> ./so_long ./maps/insert_map_file_here

The game will not work if :
Map file is not valid.
Textures in ./textures/ are not valid or have wrong names.

A valid map has to :
- Be circled by '1' characters entirely.
- Be rectangular.
- Contain at most 1 '\n' after the last map line.
- Be made out of '1', '0', 'P', 'C' and 'E' characters only.
- Have at least 1 'P', 'E' and 'C'.
- Not have more than 1 'P'.

File description elements :
- '1' : Wall.
- '0' : Walkable tile.
- 'P' : Initial Player position.
- 'C' : Collectible.
- 'E' : Exit.

Thank you for playing.
